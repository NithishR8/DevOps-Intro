Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a practice that unites software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. By fostering collaboration and leveraging automation technologies, DevOps enables faster, more reliable code deployment to production in an efficient and repeatable manner.
It aims to shorten the software development lifecycle and improve the quality and reliability of software releases.

Delivery Pipeline :
The pipeline represents the different stages that software goes through before it is released to production. These stages might typically include:

Build: The stage where the software code is compiled and packaged into a deployable unit.
Test: The stage where the software is rigorously tested to ensure it functions as expected and identifies any bugs.
Release: The stage where the software is deployed to production for end users.

A feedback loop is a process in which the outputs of a system are circled back and used as inputs. In business, this refers to the process of using customer or employee feedback (the outputs of a service or product), to create a better product or workplace.

How DevOps Works?

DevOps will remove the isolated conditions between the development team and operations team. In many cases these two teams will work together for the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function. 

Waterfall vs Agile Development | Software Development Life Cycle Models

Waterfall Model
The waterfall model is a famous and good version of SDLC(System Development Life Cycle) for software engineering. The waterfall model is a linear and sequential model, which means that a development phase cannot begin until the previous phase is completed. We cannot overlap phases in the waterfall model.

Agile Model
Agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental models, that is, it is made up of iterative and incremental models.
In Agile model, the focus is given to process adaptability and customer satisfaction.

The Waterfall model is not dead. It is still used in software development process in which requirements are well-defined and where changes are not expected during project. But when requirements are not well-define and need quick adjustments during the project, then waterfall model cannot work and Agile model is preferred. 
Although Agile has not replaced Waterfall, it has become most preferred approach to most of the software development processes due to its extra advantages like flexibility, adaptability, transparency and responsiveness.
